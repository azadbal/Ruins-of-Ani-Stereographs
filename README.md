# Ruins of Ani Steregrams
A repo of Ohannes Kurkjian 1880's stereograms of the "Ruins of Ani"

## Background
A photographer based out of Yerevan, Armenia, Ohannes Kurkjian made a trip to the historic ruins of Ani, the City of 1001 Churchs and the former capital of the Armenian Kingdom. Being on the border of the former Russian and Ottoman Empire, Ohnannes was able to "visit Ani sometime between 1875 and 1880 after the Kars district, including Ani, had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (i.e., after 1877)¹. 

While living in Yerevan, Kurkdjian produced a set of stereoscopic photographs (stereographs) depicting Ani. They were sold as a collection of forty cards, contained in a cloth-covered cardboard box decorated with embossed tooling. The collection came with an booklet telling the viewer what the subject of each photograph was.

The pairs of photographs are mounted onto printed cards manufactured in Vienna, and are the standard 90x180mm size. All the cards have the title "Ruines d'Arménie, Ani" and a facsimile of Kurkdjian's signature. They do not have individual captions, but each card is hand numbered according to the listing in the accompanying booklet¹.
